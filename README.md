## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### Option 1: GitHub Pages

1. Rename `01_index.html` to `index.html` (GitHub Pages requires this name for the homepage).
2. Push all files to your GitHub repository.
3. Go to your repository settings → Pages → Select the branch and `/root` folder.
4. Your site will be live at: `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`

> ⚠️ Ensure all referenced video/image files are also committed and in the same folder.

### Option 2: Local Deployment

1. Make sure all files (HTML, videos, images) are in the same directory.
2. Open `01_index.html` in a browser (or renamed `index.html`).
3. Works offline without a server—ideal for demos or USB presentations.

### Option 3: Netlify / Vercel

1. Drag and drop your folder to [Netlify Drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop) or deploy via CLI.
2. For Vercel:
   - Create a new project.
   - Import your repo or upload files.
   - Set the entry point as `01_index.html` or rename to `index.html`.
